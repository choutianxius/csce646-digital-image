      <p>
        You are viewing the compiled and animated shader, running in an HTML
        <code>canvas</code> element. This is achieved by implementing a minimal
        rendering engine with WebGL2, following similar behavior as ShaderToy's.
      </p>

      <p>
        Source code for this web page, as well as the rendering engine can be
        found in this

          >Github repo</a
        >.

      <h2>ShaderToy Code</h2>

      <p>
        The source code can be found in this
        <a href="/pr01/main-image-source.txt" target="_blank">link</a>. It is
        based on
        <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ndc3zl" target="_blank">
          <i>mdb</i>'s work
        </a>
        on ShaderToy, by combining the code for <code>BufferA</code> into the
        <code>Image</code> code.
      </p>

      <p>
        The clouds in the shader are created by sampling from a
        <a href="/pr01/blue_noise.png" target="_blank">blue-noise image</a>.
        <b>
          When running on ShaderToy, you should set up the blue-noise texture in
          iChannel0.
        </b>
        You can also choose other textures to generate different clouds.
      </p>

      <h2>How Is Vector to Raster Implemented</h2>

      <p>
        The train and the bridge are generated from pure vector-to-raster
        calculation. The clouds are generated by first sampling from a
        <a href="/pr01/blue_noise.png" target="_blank">blue-noise image</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>How is Image Manipulation Implemented</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          "Vignett correction" is applied to the generated frames so that the
          border regions become darker.
        </li>
        <li>I also applied varying brightness based on iTime.</li>
      </ul>
